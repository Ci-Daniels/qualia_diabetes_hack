# qualia_diabetes_hack
Repo to the AfricanTechGirl Diabetes Hackathon. This project was presented at the AfricaTechGirl Diabetes hackathon held on 29th July 2023.
The first iteration leverages patient data keyed in on the application, the machine learning model would then predict the chances of a patient having diabetes based on his vitals as keyed in the application.

# Future of the project
- Diabetic patients suffer greatly from diabetic foot ulcers. It is therefore prudent to leverage technology in addressing the afore-mentioned problem.
  
- Diabetic foot ulcers are among the most common complications of patients who have diabetes mellitus which is not well controlled. It is usually the result of poor glycemic control, underlying neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, or poor foot care. It is also one of the common causes of osteomyelitis of the foot and amputation of lower extremities. These ulcers are usually in the areas of the foot which encounter repetitive trauma and pressure sensations. Staphylococcus is the most common infective organism. The disease is typically chronic, and an interprofessional approach will have the best outcome.

- Diabetic foot ulcers are responsible for more admissions than any other diabetic complication. Today, diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic amputations in the US. Overall, people living with diabetes have a greater than 30% risk of developing a foot ulcer in their lifetime. 10% of those ulcers will result in an amputation.

# Solution
- Develop a system that leverages the Internet of Things to measure foot temperature to help reduce the risk of ulcers. Rising foot temperature indicates that inflammation is developing, which may be a sign of injury. This is a smart sock worn by patients; it has a regular connection to the cloud for the capture and sharing of temperature data with healthcare professionals. The physicians are able to monitor remotely the temperature differences in their patients and call in to check on their health in case of an anomaly in the recorded data.

# Past done projects
- Leveraged only on the temperature monitoring aspect. These include the Siren Smart sock.
- The proposed system will not only monitor the temperature variations but also take into account the classification of various types of foot injuries, feed them to a machine learning model, and make inferences as to whether they fall into the diabetes foot ulcer category or are just an injury. This will aid in the treatment and early detection of DFU.
